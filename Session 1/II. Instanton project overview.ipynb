      "## The problem\n",
      "\n",
      "* Consider a network with a significant number of wind farms.\n",
      "* Suppose the demand forecast is accurate and generation dispatch does not change (though generators do perform droop response to handle mismatches).\n",
      "* Now suppose the wind forecast is not entirely accurate. Let each wind farm's active power output be an optimization variable.\n",
      "* Now for the optimization: \n",
      "    * The objective is to minimize the normed distance between the vector of wind optimization variables and the wind forecast; we reason that the most concerning scenarios are those closest to the forecast, because they are most likely to occur. We might also insert a \"covariance\" matrix into the objective function to accommodate situations where a number of wind farms are likely to experience the same wind variations.\n",
      "    * The set of constraint functions is as you expect: power balance constraints, an angle reference, a constraint on $\\alpha$ to make sure all slack is taken up.\n",
      "    * We add one additional constraint to force a line to its active power flow limit in one direction. After optimizing with the first line constraint in place, we reverse its direction and repeat. After that optimization is complete, we move on to the next line until all have been considered.\n",
      "* In the end, we have an instanton candidate for each line constraint in the network (including both directions). Each candidate has a \"score\" -- its distance from the wind forecast -- and we call the one with the lowest score the _instanton_.\n"
